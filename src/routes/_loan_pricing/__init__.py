"""Shared loan-pricer bridge used by the property and commercial routes.

Wraps ``LoanCDM.to_pricer_inputs`` + ``LoanPricer.price_loan`` and
returns a JSON-serialisable ``{inputs, pricing}`` payload. The same helper
backs the initial (GET) load of the Loan Pricer panel and every live
re-price (POST with user overrides), so the editable form and the read-only
derivation share one code path.
