    """Verify every pipeline output exists on disk.

    Unlike ``validate_full_chain`` (which checks hash consistency of data
    that *is* present), this function checks that all expected outputs
    from ``STEP_IO`` actually exist.  A missing directory or file is a
    hard failure — the app cannot function without it.

    Args:
        data_dir: Root data directory containing pipeline outputs
                  (e.g. ``data/input/thames``).  If *None*, resolved
                  from config.

    Returns:
        Dict with ``complete`` (bool), ``missing`` (list of
        ``{step, output, path, type}`` dicts), and ``present`` count.
