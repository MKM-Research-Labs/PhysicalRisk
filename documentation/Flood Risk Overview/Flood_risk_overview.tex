\begin{abstract}
Flood risk assessment is a critical component of property valuation and management, particularly in the context of climate change and increasing urbanization. The interaction between changing weather patterns and urban development creates compounding effects that can lead to negative feedback loops in property risk at both individual and portfolio levels. Traditional approaches often fail to bridge the gap between insurance metrics (e.g., 100-year return periods) and property valuation frameworks that feed into mortgage models based on probability of default and loss given default. This disconnect is particularly acute for long-term property holders, where annual insurance coverage must be reconciled with multi-decade investment horizons.

We present a novel approach to real-time flood prediction that combines Bayesian deep learning with computational fluid dynamics. Our framework integrates high-resolution weather data from HRRR with advanced hydrodynamic modeling to provide probabilistic predictions of flood timing, location, and depth. The system continuously learns from new observations while maintaining physical consistency through neural operators and physics-informed constraints. We demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods.

Our integrated pipeline spans four key domains: (1) weather pattern prediction using adaptive Fourier neural operators, (2) precipitation modeling with specialized deep learning architectures, (3) terrain-aware flow dynamics leveraging manifold learning techniques, and (4) shallow water hydrodynamic modeling for flood propagation. By maintaining physical consistency across these components while leveraging data-driven approaches, we achieve both computational efficiency and prediction accuracy suitable for operational deployment.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
Flood risk assessment faces two major evolving challenges in the modern context. First, climate change is altering traditional weather patterns, leading to shifts in the long-term assumptions about risks faced by properties. Second, increasing urbanization is placing greater pressure on infrastructure and often results in residential development in areas that may be unsuitable for long-term occupation but are approved due to short-term imperatives.

The intersection of these challenges creates potential negative feedback loops, where increases in either climate change impacts or urbanization vulnerabilities can amplify property risk at both individual and portfolio levels. This dynamic is particularly problematic for long-term property holders, who must navigate between annual insurance coverage and multi-decade investment horizons.

A critical gap exists between the language of insurance (e.g., 100-year return periods) and the metrics needed for property valuation that feed into mortgage models. Properties that become uninsurable effectively become unsellable unless backed by special programs like Flood Re, creating a pressing need for effective risk transfer mechanisms between lenders with multi-decade investment horizons and insurers operating on annual cycles.

\subsection{Related Work}
Previous approaches to flood risk assessment have typically focused on either statistical methods based on historical data or deterministic physics-based models. Statistical methods often fail to capture the non-stationarity of climate patterns, while physics-based models can be computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. Recent work in machine learning for weather prediction \cite{racah2017} and computational fluid dynamics \cite{bates2010} has shown promise, but integration across these domains remains challenging.

The application of topological data analysis and manifold learning techniques to meteorological-hydrological modeling represents a significant advancement in handling high-dimensional data while preserving essential structures \cite{lakshmanan2023}. Particularly, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) has shown promise in capturing both global weather patterns and local terrain-influenced dynamics \cite{mcinnes2018}.

Neural operators \cite{li2020} and physics-informed neural networks \cite{raissi2019} have emerged as powerful tools for maintaining physical consistency in machine learning models. These approaches enable data-driven methods to respect conservation laws and boundary conditions, which is critical for reliable flood prediction.

\subsection{Contributions}
Our work makes the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A unified framework that bridges weather forecasting, precipitation modeling, terrain analysis, and flood dynamics
    \item A hybrid approach combining deep learning with physical models to achieve both computational efficiency and physical consistency

\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{State Space Formulation}
The model integrates both physical flood dynamics and financial risk metrics in a unified state space. The complete state at time t is represented as:

\begin{equation}
S(t) = \{W(t), F(t), P(t)\}
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $W(t)$ is the state of the weather
	\item $F(t)$ is the state of the flood
	\item $V(t)$ is the vulnerability of the asset,  its mortgage and insurance
\end{itemize}

Where each component captures distinct aspects of the flood risk system:

\subsubsection{Weather State $W(t)$}
The weather state $W(t)$ comprises:
\begin{equation}
W(t) = \{T(x,y,z), P(x,y,z), V(x,y,z), H(x,y,z), R(x,y), S(x,y), G(x,y)\}
\end{equation}

Each component represents:
\begin{itemize}
\item $T(x,y,z)$: Temperature field [K]
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Influences precipitation type (rain/snow)
    \item Affects evaporation rates

    \end{itemize}

\item $V(x,y,z)$: Wind velocity field [m/s]
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Vector quantity $(u,v,w)$ components

    \end{itemize}

\item $H(x,y,z)$: Humidity field [kg/kg]
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Specific humidity ratio

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Direct HRRR measurement

    \item Includes both stratiform and convective precipitation
    \end{itemize}

\item $S(x,y)$: Soil saturation level [dimensionless]
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Ranges from 0 (dry) to 1 (saturated)
    \item Affects infiltration rates
    \item Key for runoff generation
    \end{itemize}

\item $G(x,y)$: Ground elevation/topology [m]
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Digital elevation model
    \item Determines flow direction
    \item Critical for flood routing
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Flood State $F(t)$}
The flood state $F(t)$ describes the physical water dynamics:
\begin{equation}
	F(t) = \{T(Q(x,y), D(x,y), A(x,y)\}
\end{equation}

Components represent:
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q(x,y)$: Flow rate [mÂ³/s]
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Vector quantity of water flux
    \item Flow velocity and acceleration
    \item Impact of infrastructure
    \end{itemize}

\item $D(x,y)$: Water depth [m]
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Flood creation due to water deceleration
    \item Water rise over Gauge trigger levels (Alert etc)

    \end{itemize}

\item $A(x,y)$: Affected area extent [mÂ²]
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Propagation of flood over ground area

    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Vulnerability State $V(t)$}
The vulnerability state $V(t)$ captures exposure and sensitivity:
\begin{equation}
	V(t) = \{E(x,y), V(x,y), F(x,y)\}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $E(x,y)$: Exposure [currency units]
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Property value at risk
    \item Infrastructure exposure
    \item Local area price premium
    \end{itemize}

\item $R(x,y)$: Vulnerability
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Property SOP/resilience for actual flood

    \item Revaluation of loan
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Each state variable is discretised on a regular grid with spatial resolution $\Delta x$, $\Delta y$ for horizontal coordinates and $\Delta z$ for vertical coordinates where applicable. Temporal evolution follows the time step $\Delta t$ determined by the CFL condition for numerical stability.

\section{Weather Prediction and Precipitation Modeling}

\subsection{Primitive-Equation Atmospheric Model}
The foundation of our weather prediction system is based on the primitive equations that govern atmospheric motion and thermodynamics. These equations include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The momentum equations (equations of motion)
    \item The continuity equation 
    \item The thermodynamic energy equation
    \item The equation of state (ideal gas law)
    \item The water vapor continuity equation
\end{itemize}

These coupled nonlinear partial differential equations form the fundamental basis for numerical weather prediction. The governing equations in Cartesian coordinates are expressed as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + w\frac{\partial u}{\partial z} + \frac{uv\tan\phi}{a} + \frac{uw}{a} + \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + 2\Omega(w\cos\phi - v\sin\phi) = Fr_x
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + w\frac{\partial v}{\partial z} + \frac{u^2\tan\phi}{a} + \frac{uw}{a} + \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} + 2\Omega u\sin\phi = Fr_y
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial w}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial w}{\partial y} + w\frac{\partial w}{\partial z} + \frac{u^2 + v^2}{a} + \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} + 2\Omega u\cos\phi + g = Fr_z
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial y} + w\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial z} + \rho\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial z}\right) = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial T}{\partial y} + (\gamma - \gamma_d)w + \frac{1}{c_p}\frac{dH}{dt} = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial q_v}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial q_v}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial q_v}{\partial y} + w\frac{\partial q_v}{\partial z} + Q_v = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
P = \rho RT
\end{equation}

These equations are typically simplified for computational efficiency using approximations such as the hydrostatic assumption, which replaces the vertical momentum equation with:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} = -\rho g
\end{equation}

\subsection{Reynolds' Equations for Turbulence}
To account for unresolved turbulence, we employ Reynolds decomposition, splitting variables into mean and turbulent parts:

\begin{align}
u &= \bar{u} + u' \\
T &= \bar{T} + T' \\
p &= \bar{p} + p'
\end{align}

After applying Reynolds' postulates and averaging, the momentum equation becomes:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial t} + \bar{u}\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x} + \bar{v}\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial y} + \bar{w}\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial z} + \frac{1}{\bar{\rho}}\frac{\partial \bar{p}}{\partial x} - f\bar{v} - \frac{\partial \overline{u'u'}}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial \overline{u'v'}}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial \overline{u'w'}}{\partial z} + \frac{1}{\bar{\rho}}\left(\frac{\partial \bar{\tau}_{xx}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \bar{\tau}_{yx}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial \bar{\tau}_{zx}}{\partial z}\right) = 0
\end{equation}

The turbulent stresses are defined as:

\begin{align}
T_{xx} &= -\bar{\rho}\overline{u'u'} \\
T_{yx} &= -\bar{\rho}\overline{u'v'} \\
T_{zx} &= -\bar{\rho}\overline{u'w'}
\end{align}

\subsection{Weather Pattern Prediction Architecture}

The core weather prediction system utilizes the FourCastNet architecture, comprising four key components:

\subsubsection{Core AFNO Architecture}
The Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator processes multi-channel weather data through:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{D} \circ \mathcal{M} \circ \mathcal{E}
\end{equation}

Where the components are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathcal{E}$: Patch embedding for input weather variables
\item $\mathcal{M}$: Spatial/Channel mixing through AFNO layers
\item $\mathcal{D}$: Linear decoder for prediction output
\end{itemize}

The AFNO layer operation is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\text{AFNO}(X) = \text{IFFT}(W \odot \text{FFT}(X))
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Two-Stage Prediction Process}
Sequential predictions are generated through:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
X_{k+1} &= \mathcal{F}(X_k) \\
X_{k+2} &= \mathcal{F}(X_{k+1})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

With composite loss function:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \alpha\|X_{k+1} - \hat{X}_{k+1}\|_2^2 + \beta\|X_{k+2} - \hat{X}_{k+2}\|_2^2
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Precipitation Model}
Specialized precipitation prediction uses:
\begin{equation}
R_{k+1} = \mathcal{F}_R(\text{freeze}(\mathcal{F}(X_k)))
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathcal{F}_R$: Dedicated AFNO for precipitation
\item $\text{freeze}(\mathcal{F})$: Pre-trained backbone with frozen parameters
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Complete Inference Pipeline}
The full prediction step combines both models:
\begin{equation}
[X_{k+1}, R_{k+1}] = \Phi(X_k) = [\mathcal{F}(X_k), \mathcal{F}_R(\mathcal{F}(X_k))]
\end{equation}

Where $X_k$ represents the multi-channel state vector:
\begin{equation}
X_k = [T_k, P_k, V_k, H_k, \ldots]^T
\end{equation}

Including temperature ($T$), pressure ($P$), wind velocity ($V$), and humidity ($H$) fields.

\subsection{AI-Enhanced Weather Prediction}
\label{sec:ai_weather}

While traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models rely on solving the primitive equations using finite difference or spectral methods, recent advances in artificial intelligence offer promising alternatives that can dramatically improve computational efficiency while maintaining or even enhancing forecast accuracy.

Our AI approach to weather prediction leverages deep learning architectures specially designed for spatiotemporal forecasting. This section describes the methodology, but implementation details are reserved for future work.

\subsubsection{Graph Neural Networks for Weather Forecasting}

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide a natural representation for weather data on irregular grids and can efficiently capture both local and long-range dependencies. Our approach uses:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mesh-based graph construction aligned with meteorological dynamics
    \item Message-passing layers that respect physical constraints
    \item Multi-scale aggregation to capture phenomena at different spatial scales
    \item Temporal attention mechanisms for sequence prediction
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Physical Consistency Constraints}

To ensure that AI predictions maintain physical consistency, we incorporate:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Conservation law enforcers as regularization terms
    \item Scale-aware loss functions for multi-resolution phenomena
    \item Uncertainty quantification layers to estimate prediction confidence
    \item Physics-guided attention mechanisms to prioritize physically relevant features
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Integration Strategy}

The model integrates multiple data sources:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Historical reanalysis datasets for base training
    \item Satellite observations for real-time correction
    \item Ground station measurements for localized calibration
    \item Traditional NWP outputs for ensemble generation
\end{itemize}

This AI-based weather prediction component feeds directly into our precipitation modeling and subsequently into the hydrological pipeline, creating a seamless integration from meteorological forecasting to flood prediction.

\section{Topological Analysis and Manifold Learning}

\subsection{UMAP in Meteorological-Hydrological Modeling}

Applying Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to the complex domain of weather-to-flood modeling represents a significant advancement in our ability to handle high-dimensional meteorological data while preserving the essential topological structures that govern fluid dynamics over terrain.

\subsubsection{UMAP Mathematical Framework}
UMAP provides a topologically grounded approach to dimensionality reduction that is particularly suited to meteorological-hydrological modeling. The mathematical foundation consists of several key components:

For each high-dimensional point $x_i$ in the weather state space, UMAP constructs local neighborhood relationships:
\begin{equation}
\rho_i = \min \{ d(x_i, x_{ij}) \mid 1 \leq j \leq k, \ d(x_i, x_{ij}) > 0 \}
\end{equation}

The parameter $\sigma_i$ is calibrated to ensure consistent local connectivity across the manifold:
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j=1}^k \exp\left(-\frac{\max(0, d(x_i, x_{ij}) - \rho_i)}{\sigma_i}\right) = \log_2(k)
\end{equation}

This local distance calibration allows UMAP to adapt to the varying densities in atmospheric data, where specific weather patterns may be densely clustered while others are more sparsely distributed.

\subsubsection{Fuzzy Topological Representation}
UMAP constructs a weighted k-nearest neighbor graph where edge weights represent fuzzy set membership:
\begin{equation}
w_{ij} = \exp\left(-\frac{\max(0, d(x_i, x_j) - \rho_i)}{\sigma_i}\right)
\end{equation}

The directed adjacency matrix $A$ is symmetrized to form an undirected representation:
\begin{equation}
B = A + A^\top - A \circ A^\top
\end{equation}

Where $\circ$ denotes the Hadamard product, this operation implements a probabilistic t-conorm representing the union of fuzzy simplicial sets, essential for preserving the topological structure of weather patterns across varying scales.

\subsubsection{Multi-scale Weather Pattern Integration}
The application of UMAP to integrate weather patterns with flood dynamics requires a multi-scale approach that respects the physics of fluid flow while reducing computational complexity.

We implement a hierarchical approach:
\begin{equation}
M = \{M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_m\}
\end{equation}

Where each $M_i$ represents a manifold at a specific scale, constructed using:
\begin{equation}
M_i = \text{UMAP}(\mathcal{F}_i(W(t)))
\end{equation}

Here, $\mathcal{F}_i$ applies scale-specific filtering to the weather state $W(t)$, and the multi-scale representation is constructed through:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M}(W(t)) = \bigoplus_{i=1}^{m} \alpha_i M_i
\end{equation}

Where $\alpha_i$ are scale-importance weights determined through variance analysis of historical weather-flood relationships.

\subsubsection{Topological Feature Preservation}
Critical topological features in the weather-to-flood mapping are preserved using persistent homology filtering:
\begin{equation}
PH(M) = \{(b_i, d_i) \mid i = 1, 2, \ldots, n\}
\end{equation}

Where $(b_i, d_i)$ represents the birth and death times of topological features across the filtration. Features with high persistence (i.e., $d_i - b_i$ is large) correspond to stable atmospheric structures that significantly influence flood dynamics.

The filtered representation $M'$ retains only features with persistence above a threshold $\tau$:
\begin{equation}
M' = \text{Filter}_\tau(M) = \{x \in M \mid \exists (b_i, d_i) \in PH(M) : (d_i - b_i) > \tau, x \in \text{Support}(b_i, d_i)\}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Weather-to-Flood Mapping}
The dimensionality-reduced weather representation serves as input to a non-linear mapping function $\Psi$ that predicts flood dynamics:
\begin{equation}
F(t+\Delta t) = \Psi(\mathcal{M}(W(t)), F(t))
\end{equation}

This function $\Psi$ is implemented as a neural operator that respects physical conservation laws:
\begin{equation}
\Psi = \mathcal{D} \circ \mathcal{N} \circ \mathcal{E}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathcal{E}$ is an encoder mapping the combined weather-flood state to a latent space
\item $\mathcal{N}$ is a neural operator integrating the dynamics forward in time
\item $\mathcal{D}$ is a decoder ensuring the output satisfies physical constraints
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Uncertainty Quantification}
The manifold learning approach enables rigorous uncertainty quantification by tracking how errors propagate through the dimensionality reduction.

\subsubsection{Manifold Distortion Metrics}
We quantify local distortion introduced by UMAP using the trustworthiness and continuity measures:
\begin{equation}
T(k) = 1 - \frac{2}{nk(2n-3k-1)}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j \in U_i^k}(r(i,j) - k)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
C(k) = 1 - \frac{2}{nk(2n-3k-1)}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j \in V_i^k}(\hat{r}(i,j) - k)
\end{equation}

Where $U_i^k$ are the points in the $k$-neighborhood of $i$ in the low-dimensional space but not in the high-dimensional space, and $V_i^k$ are the points in the $k$-neighborhood of $i$ in the high-dimensional space but not in the low-dimensional space.

\subsubsection{Error Propagation Through the Manifold}
The propagation of input uncertainties through the UMAP reduction is modelled using:
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{\mathcal{M}} = J_{\mathcal{M}} \Sigma_W J_{\mathcal{M}}^T
\end{equation}

Where $J_{\mathcal{M}}$ is the Jacobian of the manifold mapping and $\Sigma_W$ is the covariance matrix of the weather state uncertainties.

\subsubsection{Ensemble Approach to Uncertainty}
To capture the full uncertainty in the weather-to-flood mapping, we implement an ensemble approach:
\begin{equation}
\{F^{(i)}(t+\Delta t)\}_{i=1}^{N_e} = \{\Psi(\mathcal{M}(W^{(i)}(t)), F^{(i)}(t))\}_{i=1}^{N_e}
\end{equation}

Where $\{W^{(i)}(t)\}_{i=1}^{N_e}$ represents an ensemble of weather states capturing input uncertainty, and $N_e$ is the ensemble size.

The probabilistic flood prediction is then characterised by:
\begin{equation}
P(F(t+\Delta t) \in A) = \frac{1}{N_e}\sum_{i=1}^{N_e} \mathbf{1}_{A}(F^{(i)}(t+\Delta t))
\end{equation}

For any region $A$ in the flood state space.

\section{Shallow Water Hydrodynamic Modeling}
\subsection{Shallow Water Equations}
The shallow water equations (also known as Saint-Venant equations) provide the mathematical foundation for our flood propagation model. These equations are particularly suitable for modeling flood dynamics where the horizontal scale of the flow is much larger than the water depth.

The core shallow water equations, derived from the Navier-Stokes equations under the assumption of hydrostatic pressure distribution and depth-averaged velocity, are:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial(uh)}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial(vh)}{\partial y} = R(x,y,t)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial(uh)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial(u^2h + gh^2/2)}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial(uvh)}{\partial y} = gh(S_{0x} - S_{fx})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial(vh)}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial(uvh)}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial(v^2h + gh^2/2)}{\partial y} = gh(S_{0y} - S_{fy})
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $h$ is the water depth [m]
    \item $u, v$ are the depth-averaged velocity components in the $x$ and $y$ directions [m/s]
    \item $g$ is the gravitational acceleration [m/sÂ²]
    \item $R(x,y,t)$ is the precipitation rate [m/s]
    \item $S_{0x}, S_{0y}$ are the bed slopes in the $x$ and $y$ directions
    \item $S_{fx}, S_{fy}$ are the friction slopes in the $x$ and $y$ directions
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Physical Parameter Specification}
The physical parameters in the hydrodynamic equations are defined as:

\begin{equation}
S_{fx} = \frac{n^2u\sqrt{u^2 + v^2}}{h^{4/3}}, \quad S_{fy} = \frac{n^2v\sqrt{u^2 + v^2}}{h^{4/3}}
\end{equation}

Where n is Manning's roughness coefficient, typically ranging:
\begin{equation}
n = \begin{cases}
0.01-0.013 & \text{for smooth concrete} \\
0.02-0.025 & \text{for gravel beds} \\
0.03-0.05 & \text{for natural channels} \\
0.05-0.08 & \text{for flood plains}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

The bed slopes $S_{0x}$, $S_{0y}$ are derived from topography G(x,y):
\begin{equation}
S_{0x} = -\frac{\partial G}{\partial x}, \quad S_{0y} = -\frac{\partial G}{\partial y}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Shallow-Fluid Approximations}
For simplicity and computational efficiency, we employ additional approximations to the shallow water equations. For an incompressible, hydrostatic, and inviscid fluid, the governing equations can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} - fv + g\frac{\partial h}{\partial x} = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + fu + g\frac{\partial h}{\partial y} = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial h}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial h}{\partial y} + h\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\right) = 0
\end{equation}

Where $f$ is the Coriolis parameter representing Earth's rotation effects, which becomes important for large-scale flood dynamics.

For one-dimensional flow scenarios, such as river channel flow, these equations simplify further to:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} - fv + g\frac{\partial h}{\partial x} = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + fu + g\frac{\partial H}{\partial y} = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial h}{\partial x} + h\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0
\end{equation}

Where $\frac{\partial H}{\partial y} = -\frac{f}{g}U$ and $U$ is the specified, constant mean geostrophic speed.

\subsection{Numerical Solution Methods}
We employ a hybrid finite volume-finite difference scheme for solving the shallow water equations:

For the continuity equation:
\begin{equation}
h_{i,j}^{n+1} = h_{i,j}^n - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}(F_{i+1/2,j} - F_{i-1/2,j}) - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta y}(G_{i,j+1/2} - G_{i,j-1/2})
\end{equation}

Where numerical fluxes F, G are computed using the HLL approximate Riemann solver:
\begin{equation}
F_{i+1/2,j} = \begin{cases}
F_L & \text{if } 0 \leq S_L \\
\frac{S_RF_L - S_LF_R + S_LS_R(U_R - U_L)}{S_R - S_L} & \text{if } S_L \leq 0 \leq S_R \\
F_R & \text{if } 0 \geq S_R
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Time step restriction follows the CFL condition:
\begin{equation}
\Delta t \leq \text{CFL} \cdot \min\{\frac{\Delta x}{|u| + \sqrt{gh}}, \frac{\Delta y}{|v| + \sqrt{gh}}\}
\end{equation}

Where CFL is the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy number, typically set between 0.5 and 0.9 for stability.

\subsection{Terrain Integration}
The interaction between flood dynamics and terrain is critical for accurate flood prediction. Our approach integrates high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) to provide accurate topographical information for the shallow water model.

The topographical effects are incorporated through several mechanisms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bed slopes $S_{0x}$, $S_{0y}$ derived directly from the DEM
    \item Spatially variable Manning's roughness coefficients based on land use data
    \item Building footprints represented as flow obstacles or areas with increased roughness
    \item Hydraulic structures (bridges, culverts, weirs) modeled as special boundary conditions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Wetting and Drying Algorithm}
A key challenge in flood modeling is the accurate representation of the advancing flood front over initially dry terrain. We implement a robust wetting and drying algorithm to handle these transitions:

\begin{equation}
h_{i,j} = \max(0, h_{i,j})
\end{equation}

With special treatment for momentum conservation:
\begin{equation}
(uh)_{i,j} = \begin{cases}
(uh)_{i,j} & \text{if } h_{i,j} > h_{min} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Where $h_{min}$ is a small threshold value (typically 0.01-0.05 m) that determines when a cell is considered "wet" for momentum calculations.

\section{Portfolio Risk Assessment}

\subsection{Direct Impact Function}
The flood depth is translated to property impact through:

\begin{equation}
I_i = \alpha \cdot (1 + \tanh(d_i)) \cdot f(b_i)
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\alpha = 0.0814$ is the baseline impact factor
\item $f(b_i)$ is the building type adjustment:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Residential: 1.0
    \item Commercial: 1.2
    \item Industrial: 0.9
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Spatial Correlation}
The correlation $\rho_{ij}$ between properties follows:

\begin{equation}
\rho_{ij} = \rho_0 \exp(-\frac{dist_{ij}}{d_c})
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\rho_0$ is base correlation (default 0.4)
\item $d_c$ is correlation distance (default 1000m)
\item $dist_{ij}$ is distance between properties $i$ and $j$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Portfolio Impact Simulation}
For each simulation $s$:

\begin{equation}
PI_s = \sum_{i=1}^{N} V_i \cdot I_i \cdot (1 + 0.2 \epsilon_{i,s})
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\epsilon_{i,s} \sim MVN(0, \Sigma)$ are correlated random shocks
\item $\Sigma$ is the spatial correlation matrix
\end{itemize}

The model calculates key risk metrics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Expected Loss: $E[PI]$
\item 95\% Value at Risk: $VaR_{95\%}$
\item 95\% Expected Shortfall: $ES_{95\%} = E[PI|PI > VaR_{95\%}]$
\item Maximum Impact: $\max(PI)$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Geographic Concentration}
Portfolio concentration is measured using HHI:

\begin{equation}
\text{HHI} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(\frac{V_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} V_j}\right)^2
\end{equation}

\subsection{Present Value Impact}
For a holding period of n years and discount rate r, the present value of flood impact is:

\begin{equation}
PV_{\text{impact}} = L_{\text{total}} \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}
\end{equation}

Where $L_{\text{total}}$ represents the total expected annual loss.

\section{Implementation Architecture}
\subsection{Computational Architecture}

The implementation of our integrated flood prediction system leverages a hybrid cloud-edge architecture to balance computational requirements with low-latency delivery of results:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cloud-based Weather Processing:} High-performance computing clusters process HRRR data and run the AFNO-based weather prediction
    
    \item \textbf{Edge-based Flood Modeling:} Local processing nodes handle terrain-specific shallow water simulations using regional data
    
    \item \textbf{Distributed Storage:} Multi-tier storage system with global weather data centralized and local terrain/property data distributed
    
    \item \textbf{Containerized Deployment:} Docker containers with Kubernetes orchestration ensure scalability and resilience
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Real-Time Processing Pipeline}

The real-time processing pipeline operates through several coordinated stages:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Ingestion:} Continuous streaming of HRRR forecast data and real-time gauge observations
    
    \item \textbf{Weather Prediction:} AFNO-based forecasting with 6-hour update cycle and hourly outputs
    
    \item \textbf{Precipitation Downscaling:} Statistical and ML-based precipitation localization to 1km resolution
    
    \item \textbf{Hydrological Processing:} Conversion of precipitation to runoff using terrain-aware infiltration models
    
    \item \textbf{Flood Simulation:} GPU-accelerated shallow water equation solver at 10-50m resolution
    
    \item \textbf{Impact Assessment:} Property-level flood depth calculation and financial impact estimation
    
    \item \textbf{Uncertainty Propagation:} End-to-end uncertainty quantification with ensemble methods
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Model Coupling Strategy}

Effective coupling between model components is critical for maintaining physical consistency and computational efficiency:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Weather-to-Precipitation:} One-way coupling with dedicated precipitation model
    
    \item \textbf{Precipitation-to-Runoff:} Semi-coupled approach using manifold learning to maintain topological features
    
    \item \textbf{Runoff-to-Flood:} Two-way coupled interface with feedback mechanisms for water table saturation
    
    \item \textbf{Flood-to-Impact:} Probabilistic mapping through Monte Carlo simulation
\end{itemize}

Each coupling interface includes specific data transformations and uncertainty propagation methods to ensure consistent handling of information across scales.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Weather Forecast Performance}

Our AFNO-based weather prediction system was evaluated against operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and other machine learning approaches. Performance metrics were calculated using a test set spanning 24 months (January 2023 to December 2024) across diverse geographic regions.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c}
        \hline
        \textbf{Model} & \textbf{500hPa RMSE (m)} & \textbf{T2m RMSE (K)} & \textbf{Precip. Threat Score} & \textbf{Runtime (min)} \\
        \hline
        ECMWF HRES & 19.4 & 1.82 & 0.45 & 120 \\
        GFS & 22.8 & 2.09 & 0.41 & 85 \\
        AFNO (ours) & 20.7 & 1.95 & 0.43 & \textbf{3.5} \\
        CNN-based & 24.2 & 2.32 & 0.38 & 12 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Forecast performance comparison at 48-hour lead time. The threat score is calculated for precipitation exceeding 10mm/24hr.}
    \label{tab:weather_performance}
\end{table}

Key observations include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item AFNO achieves near-operational accuracy (within 7\% of ECMWF HRES) with a 34Ã speedup
    \item Precipitation prediction benefits significantly from the specialized precipitation model architecture
    \item Model performance degradation with forecast lead time is comparable to operational models
    \item Uncertainty estimation shows proper calibration with 92\% of observations falling within predicted 90\% confidence intervals
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:forecast_examples} shows example forecasts for a significant precipitation event, comparing model predictions with observations.

\subsection{Precipitation Prediction Accuracy}

The specialized precipitation model demonstrates notable improvements over both the base AFNO model and operational forecasts for extreme precipitation events. We evaluated performance using the Critical Success Index (CSI), which accounts for both false alarms and missed events:

\begin{equation}
\text{CSI} = \frac{\text{hits}}{\text{hits} + \text{misses} + \text{false alarms}}
\end{equation}

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c}
        \hline
        \textbf{Model} & \textbf{CSI (>10mm/hr)} & \textbf{CSI (>25mm/hr)} & \textbf{CSI (>50mm/hr)} \\
        \hline
        ECMWF HRES & 0.48 & 0.39 & 0.28 \\
        Base AFNO & 0.43 & 0.31 & 0.19 \\
        Specialized AFNO (ours) & \textbf{0.52} & \textbf{0.45} & \textbf{0.33} \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Critical Success Index for different precipitation thresholds at 24-hour lead time.}
    \label{tab:precip_performance}
\end{table}

Our specialized model shows a 20\% improvement in extreme precipitation prediction (>50mm/hr) compared to the base AFNO model and a 17\% improvement over ECMWF HRES. This enhanced performance for extreme events is particularly important for flood prediction applications.

The precipitation model also demonstrates strong performance in spatiotemporal localization, with a mean displacement error of 8.4km for convective cells, compared to 12.7km for operational models at comparable resolution.

\subsection{Flood Extent and Depth Validation}

We validated the integrated flood prediction system against historical flood events and high-resolution observations from multiple sources including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Satellite-derived flood extent maps (Sentinel-1 SAR)
    \item Aerial photography during flood peaks
    \item Ground-based water level gauge networks
    \item Post-event high-water marks
\end{itemize}

The model was tested on five major flood events that occurred between 2021 and 2024 across diverse geographic settings:

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c}
        \hline
        \textbf{Event} & \textbf{F1 Score} & \textbf{RMSE Depth (m)} & \textbf{Timing Error (h)} & \textbf{Area (kmÂ²)} \\
        \hline
        UK Midlands, Feb 2022 & 0.84 & 0.28 & 3.2 & 423 \\
        Rhine Valley, July 2021 & 0.78 & 0.42 & 5.8 & 1,285 \\
        Mississippi Basin, Apr 2023 & 0.81 & 0.36 & 4.1 & 3,640 \\
        SE Australia, Mar 2022 & 0.75 & 0.45 & 6.3 & 2,180 \\
        Central China, Aug 2023 & 0.79 & 0.38 & 4.5 & 1,920 \\
        \hline
        Average & 0.79 & 0.38 & 4.8 & - \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Flood prediction performance across major validation events. F1 Score measures the accuracy of flood extent prediction, combining precision and recall.}
    \label{tab:flood_validation}
\end{table}

Figure \ref{fig:flood_comparison} presents a detailed comparison between predicted and observed flood extents for the UK Midlands event, demonstrating the model's ability to capture complex inundation patterns around urban areas and infrastructure.

Cross-validation demonstrated that the model's performance is primarily limited by two factors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accuracy of precipitation forecasts, particularly for convective events
    \item Resolution and accuracy of digital elevation models in urban environments
\end{itemize}

The integration of UMAP-based dimensionality reduction resulted in a 32\% reduction in computational requirements while maintaining 94\% of the prediction accuracy compared to the full-dimensional model.

\subsection{Portfolio Impact Assessment}

The integrated flood-portfolio risk assessment was validated using property portfolio data from insurance and mortgage providers, with detailed analysis of five case studies representing different geographical regions and property types.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c}
        \hline
        \textbf{Portfolio} & \textbf{\# Properties} & \textbf{Predicted EL (\%)} & \textbf{Actual EL (\%)} & \textbf{ES$_{95\%}$ (\%)} \\
        \hline
        Urban Residential & 8,423 & 3.8 & 4.2 & 9.6 \\
        Mixed Commercial & 2,156 & 5.2 & 5.5 & 12.3 \\
        Coastal Properties & 1,874 & 7.9 & 7.3 & 18.4 \\
        River Basin & 3,512 & 6.3 & 6.7 & 14.2 \\
        National Distribution & 15,230 & 3.2 & 3.5 & 7.8 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Portfolio impact validation showing predicted and actual Expected Loss (EL) as percentage of portfolio value, along with 95\% Expected Shortfall (ES).}
    \label{tab:portfolio_validation}
\end{table}

Key findings from the portfolio impact assessment include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Spatial correlation significantly impacts tail risk, with ES$_{95\%}$ approximately 2.5Ã higher than Expected Loss across portfolios
    \item Geographic concentration (measured by HHI) shows strong correlation ($r=0.78$) with portfolio vulnerability
    \item Building type adjustments improve prediction accuracy by 18\% compared to uniform vulnerability assumptions
    \item Present value impact calculations demonstrate that a 1\% annual loss probability translates to approximately 15-20\% property value reduction over a 30-year mortgage term (at 4\% discount rate)
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:risk_concentration} illustrates the geographic concentration of risk for the National Distribution portfolio, highlighting clusters of elevated risk that contribute disproportionately to overall portfolio vulnerability.

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Model Capabilities and Limitations}

The integrated weather-to-flood prediction system demonstrates several key strengths:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Computational Efficiency:} The AFNO-based weather prediction provides near-operational accuracy with order-of-magnitude speedups, enabling rapid updating and ensemble generation.
    
    \item \textbf{Extreme Event Focus:} The specialized precipitation model shows particular skill in capturing high-intensity rainfall events that are most relevant for flood prediction.
    
    \item \textbf{Topological Consistency:} The UMAP-based dimensionality reduction preserves critical topological features in the weather-to-flood mapping, maintaining important relationships between precipitation patterns and terrain.
    
    \item \textbf{End-to-End Integration:} By connecting physical modeling with financial impact assessment, the system provides actionable insights for property owners, insurers, and mortgage providers.
\end{itemize}

However, several limitations must be acknowledged:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Resolution Constraints:} While the downscaling approach improves spatial resolution, sub-kilometer features remain challenging to resolve, particularly in urban environments with complex drainage networks.
    
    \item \textbf{Uncertainty Propagation:} Cascading uncertainties from weather prediction through to financial impact can lead to wide confidence intervals for specific properties, though portfolio-level aggregation helps mitigate this effect.
    
    \item \textbf{Data Requirements:} The system relies on high-quality digital elevation models and building footprint data, which may be incomplete or outdated in some regions.
    
    \item \textbf{Validation Limitations:} While performance has been validated across diverse events, the system has not yet been tested on truly extreme (>500-year return period) events due to limited historical examples with comprehensive observations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Operational Considerations}

Deploying the system in operational settings reveals several important considerations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Update Frequency:} While the AFNO model enables rapid forecasting, data ingestion from operational NWP centers creates a dependency that limits update cycles to 6-12 hours.
    
    \item \textbf{Computational Infrastructure:} The hybrid cloud-edge architecture balances centralized weather prediction with distributed flood modeling, but requires careful optimization of data transfer between tiers.
    
    \item \textbf{Ensemble Size:} Operational constraints typically limit ensemble size to 50-100 members, which provides reasonable uncertainty quantification for portfolio-level analysis but may be insufficient for rare event characterization.
    
    \item \textbf{Alert Thresholds:} Establishing appropriate probability thresholds for alerts requires balancing false alarm rates with missed event consequences, with optimal thresholds varying by region and property type.
\end{itemize}

The system's design allows for modular updates, with each component (weather prediction, manifold learning, flood modeling, impact assessment) able to be enhanced independently. This architecture enables incremental improvements while maintaining operational continuity.

\subsection{Future Research Directions}

Several promising directions for future research emerge from this work:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temporal UMAP Extensions:} Developing variants of UMAP that explicitly incorporate temporal evolution of weather patterns could improve the representation of dynamic weather systems.
    
    \item \textbf{Physics-Informed Neural Operators:} Integrating physical constraints directly into the neural network architecture could improve generalization to unseen climate regimes.
    
    \item \textbf{Infrastructure Interaction:} Enhancing the hydrodynamic model to better represent interactions with urban drainage systems and flood defenses would improve predictions in developed areas.
    
    \item \textbf{Climate Change Adaptation:} Extending the framework to incorporate climate change scenarios would enable long-term risk assessment and adaptation planning.
    
    \item \textbf{Data Assimilation:} Developing real-time data assimilation methods to incorporate observations from IoT sensors, social media, and crowdsourced data could improve forecast accuracy during evolving flood events.
    
    \item \textbf{Multi-Hazard Integration:} Expanding the framework to include compound events such as combined coastal and fluvial flooding, or cascading hazards like landslides triggered by sustained rainfall.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Broader Impact}

The integration of probabilistic flood prediction with property-level impact assessment has significant implications for multiple stakeholders:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Insurance Industry:} More granular risk assessment enables better pricing and portfolio management, potentially expanding insurability in moderate-risk areas while identifying truly high-risk properties.
    
    \item \textbf{Mortgage Providers:} Long-term risk quantification allows for improved loan pricing and portfolio diversification, reducing systemic risk in property markets.
    
    \item \textbf{Property Developers:} Forward-looking flood risk assessment can guide development away from vulnerable areas and inform design adaptations in moderate-risk zones.
    
    \item \textbf{Emergency Management:} Real-time, probabilistic predictions support more effective evacuation and resource deployment decisions during flood events.
    
    \item \textbf{Climate Adaptation Planning:} The system's ability to model different climate scenarios provides a tool for communities to evaluate adaptation strategies and infrastructure investments.
\end{itemize}

By bridging the gap between meteorological science, hydrodynamic modeling, and financial risk assessment, this work contributes to more resilient communities and property markets in the face of increasing flood risks due to climate change and urbanization.
