# Coding Rules — PhysicalRisk

**Status:** Living document. Started 2026-06-19 during the JSON→PostgreSQL migration
(`docs/json_to_postgres_migration.md`); intended to apply **project-wide and to all future
initiatives**. Add rules here as we agree them — this file is the single source of truth.

Each rule has: the rule, *why*, *how to comply*, and *how it's verified* (ideally a CI
audit, not just goodwill). A rule isn't "done" until there's a way to check it mechanically.

---

## R1 — No hardcoded parameters outside the `config` package

**Rule.** Every parameter — filenames, directory names, magic numbers, thresholds,
field-name lists, default modes, prefixes — lives in the `config/` package. No literal
parameter values anywhere else.

**Why.** One place to change a value; no drift; reviewable; makes data/layout/behaviour
changes safe and auditable. Extends the existing path-definition audit from *paths* to
*all parameters*.

**How to comply.**
- Put the constant in the right `config` module (e.g. data-layout literals in
  `config/data_layout.py`; pricing/model params in `config/...`).
- Import and reference it; never inline the literal.
- Derive, don't duplicate: e.g. a per-key filename comes from a configured pattern
  (`"gauge_{key}_hd.json"`) split on `{key}`, not from a second literal.

```python
# ✗ bad
path = base / "gauge.json"
# ✓ good
from config.data_layout import PORTFOLIO_FILES
path = base / PORTFOLIO_FILES["gauge"]
```

**Verified by.** The path-definition audit (`config/path/registry.py` + scanner) — to be
extended to flag literal parameters outside `config` (migration task 0.8).

## R2 — No file longer than 300 lines

**Rule.** No non-test source file exceeds 300 lines. When a file grows past it, split it
into a package of focused modules.

**Why.** Small files are readable, testable, and reviewable; they force clear seams and
single-responsibility modules.

**How to comply.**
- Split by concern, not arbitrarily (one module per domain/responsibility).
- Prefer a package (`foo/` with submodules) over one long file.
- A package's `__init__.py` re-exports; it does not hold logic (see R4).

> Worked example: the `database` package is 16 modules, largest ~130 lines, instead of
> one ~500-line file.

**Verified by.** The 300-line audit (existing repo initiative). Run ad hoc:
`find src -name '*.py' -not -path '*/tests/*' | xargs wc -l | awk '$1>300'`.

## R3 — ≥99% test coverage, verified after each stage

**Rule.** Maintain ≥99% line coverage. Check it at the end of **every stage**, not just at
the end of a project.

**Why.** Catches regressions immediately; keeps the safety net tight as the codebase grows;
makes refactors (like the file→DB backend swap) safe.

**How to comply.**
- Write tests alongside the code in the same stage.
- Run the package-scoped coverage before calling a stage done.

```bash
source /Users/newdavid/Documents/PhysicalRisk/.venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest tests/<area> --cov=<package> --cov-report=term-missing
```

**Verified by.** `pyproject.toml` `fail_under = 99`. NOTE: `core = "ctrace"` is set there to
avoid a Python 3.13.1 `sys.monitoring` bug that silently deflates whole-suite coverage by
~15 points; do not remove it.

---

## R4 — No functions in `__init__.py`

**Rule.** `__init__.py` files contain only imports and `__all__` — no `def`, no `lambda`,
no logic.

**Why.** Keeps package entry points to a clear, scannable public surface; pushes
implementation into named, testable modules; avoids import-time side effects.

**How to comply.**
- Implementations live in submodules (e.g. domain modules `portfolio.py`, `trading.py`).
- Shared private helpers go in a `_helpers.py`, not `__init__.py`.
- Cross-cutting state (e.g. backend selection) gets its own module (`backend.py`).

```python
# database/__init__.py — re-exports only
from .portfolio import list_gauges, get_gauge, save_gauges
__all__ = ["list_gauges", "get_gauge", "save_gauges"]
```

**Verified by.** Ad hoc: `grep -nE "^\s*(def |lambda)" **/__init__.py`. To be folded into
the structural audit.

## R5 — Every source file carries the canonical copyright header

**Rule.** Every first-party `.py` and `.js` file must begin with the exact 19-line MKM
Research Labs license header from `docs/shared/copyright.py` (after an optional shebang).

**Why.** Legal/licensing clarity on every file; uniformity; a single canonical source for
the text so it can be updated in one place.

**How to comply.**
- Copy the header verbatim from `docs/shared/copyright.py` — **including its intentional
  trailing whitespace** on a few lines; the audit compares lines exactly.
- Place it at the very top (after a shebang if present), before the module docstring.
- Never hand-retype it (whitespace drift fails the audit); copy from the canonical file.

**Verified by.** `docs/models/full_audit/sections_tests/copyright_headers.py` — a
**self-healing** audit (`is_compliant` / `fix_text` / `fix_repo`) exercised by
`tests/commands/test_copyright_headers_report.py`, which repairs headers in place under
`app.py test`. Note: run the repo-wide self-heal in the main checkout, not a worktree
(dry-run `fix_repo(root, apply=False)` only in worktrees).

---

## Adding a new rule (template)

```
## R<N> — <one-line rule>

**Rule.** <precise statement>
**Why.** <the motivation / failure it prevents>
**How to comply.** <concrete guidance, ideally with a good/bad example>
**Verified by.** <the audit/test/command that enforces it — add one if missing>
```

Candidate rules to consider as the project matures: single data-access utility (all DB
access via `database/`, zero SQL elsewhere — see `docs/json_to_postgres_migration.md` §2.0);
no embedded JavaScript in `.py` files; no mutating runs in a worktree; copyright header on
every source file.

## Change log

- 2026-06-19 — Created with R1–R4. First applied to the `database` package (WP0 of the
  JSON→PostgreSQL migration): all four satisfied, 100% coverage.
- 2026-06-19 — Added R5 (canonical copyright header) and applied it to all WP0 files.
