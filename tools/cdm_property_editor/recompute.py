"""On-demand single-asset PRS recompute — the instant "re-depth" shortcut.

For a property edit that only moves the flood threshold (FloorLevelMeters or
BRIFloodScore), recompute the PRS spread decomposition WITHOUT re-running the
flood propagation. Spike 1 established that each stored event's
``attenuated_wse_m`` (the property peak water-surface elevation) is independent
of floor / ground / BRI, and that the batch's flood depth is exactly
``max(0, attenuated_wse_m − threshold)``. So a new floor just re-thresholds the
stored water levels:

    new_depth_i = max(0, attenuated_wse_m_i − (threshold + Δfloor))

The threshold is read back from the data itself (``attenuated_wse_m − depth`` on
any flooded event — constant per file, validated to 0.0000 spread), so we never
reconstruct it from metadata (which is wrong for the SHD mode). Counting uses the
shared ``is_prs_flood`` and the spread is the same ``count / num_storms × 10000``
the batch uses, so the pricing stays single-source.

Returns ``None`` (→ caller falls back to the scoped-subprocess oracle) for edits
or data this shortcut cannot reproduce exactly: ground-level edits (mode-specific
geometry) and compound/pulse events (stored peak WSE is lossy when not flooded).
