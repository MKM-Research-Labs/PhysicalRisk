"""Copyright-header audit — self-heal, logic and full-audit section tests.

Sits with the other audit-report tests (test_embedded_js_report.py, …).

``TestCopyrightHeadersRepo`` runs the header fixer across the whole repository:
any ``.py``/``.js`` file whose header is missing or differs from
``docs/shared/copyright.py`` is rewritten in place, then the test asserts every
file is compliant.  It repairs before asserting, so it is self-healing — the
rewrite simply surfaces as a git diff, which is the signal a header was wrong.

``TestCopyrightHeaderLogic`` pins the detect/replace/insert behaviour with
synthetic input (``tmp``-style, no repo mutation), and ``TestCopyrightSection``
smoke-tests the full-audit subsection builder.
